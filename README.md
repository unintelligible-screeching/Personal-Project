Hi everyone, this is my first project practicing data analysis. This dataset was pulled from Kaggle.  
Here is the source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmohaiminulislam/ecommerce-data-analysis?select=item_dim.csv  
This dataset is compromised of 6 dataframes (as of 10/04/2024).    
** fact_table ** : serves as main dataframe detailing the purchases made by customers.  
** trans_dim ** : detailing sources of transactions   
** customer_dim ** : phone and name of customers   
** item_dim ** : information about products that are being sold  
** store_dim ** : stores locations   
** time_dim ** : dictionary for time keys   
In this project I started by reviewing companies performance and have identified a few of its problems.   
To give a meanningful solutions to the problems, I must understand what business they are running.   
After identifying its business operation and type, the solutions were implementation of Basket Analysis output to make incentives for its customers and a recommendation system to increase the buyers experiences.

** Caveats ** : The data is theoretical, meaning the creator did not factor in all the deatils, although usable, it may not represent the real world use cases. Thus some assumption that were made may seem a bit out of nowhere, so please advise.
